<!-- setAttribute always overwrites the previous value and works in key:value method -->

<!-- title.innerText gives only the visible content; whereas -->
<!-- title.textContent gives the hidden content also -- this is the major difference between both -->
<!-- title.innerHTML gives whatever written as the text along with the HTML attributes -->

<!-- Ways to get element is many: some is getElementById and getElementByClassName -->

<!-- document.querySelector gives only the first query which is passed as parameter -->
<!-- querySelector supports same as CSS Selectors -->
<!-- querySelector also manipulates value of the element -->

<!-- document.querySelectorAll gives all the queries which is passed as parameter and manipulates it-->
<!-- If there is a list, then it considers as a node (similar to array) but not array; and then have to manipulate each element by taking the particular index of that node -->
<!-- If want to change all elements of the list; use foreach loop since it is nodelist not an array (where we can use map) -->

<!-- HTML Collection (when getting elements from ClassName) is different from Nodelist; so can't use foreach loop in that case -->
<!-- To use foreach loop, change the HTML Collection into an array by using Array.from(variableName) -->
